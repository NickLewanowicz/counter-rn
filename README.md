# Counter App in React Native!
`04/10/2018` This will be my first react native application built for production. It will be a fairly trivial example but one that I plan to bring through all steps of production including publishing to both the androind and iOS app store. 

This application will be done with `react-native` cli tool rather than `create-react-native-app` which bakes in many creature comforts but will reduce flexibility with native library features and react-native addons that leverage native iOS and Android binaries.

The goals will be to make a clean, simple, aesthetic application that will be available for free on the App Store and Play Store, I will provide the links to which below when this process is complete. </br>

`04/20/2018` Progress has been made as Ive completed the 'design' of the application though more functionality may be offered (multiple counters, reset button, ect) I have began the initial process of submitting to the App Store and will be submitting the the Play store shortly. </br>
